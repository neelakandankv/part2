    Answer 2 <BR> You can select your DP to open a demat account just like you select a bank for opening a savings account. Some of the important factors for selection of a DP can be:
    Convenience - Proximity to your office/residence, business hours.
    Comfort - Reputation of the DP, past association with the organization, whether the DP is in a position to give the specific service you may need?
    Cost/ level of service - The service charges levied by DP and the service standards.

    <li> <a name="question3"> </a> Answer 3 <br> NSDL has specified certain basic eligibility criteria for becoming a DP. The criteria are similar or even higher in certain respects than the corresponding provisions of SEBI regulations. All the DPs are same in the sense they are appointed by NSDL only after grant of Certificate of Registration by SEBI to them. However, the type of services offered, service standards and charges for the services rendered may differ among DPs.

    <li> <a name="question4"> </a>>Answer 4 <br> Once you have decided to open an account with a particular DP, you may approach that DP and fill up an account opening form. You would be required to provide your photograph and self-attested copy of following documents -
    PAN Card (for Sikkim residents who may not have PAN, other proof of identity).
    Proof of address (any one of Passport, Driving license, Voter’s Identity card, Aadhaar card and NREGA job card).
    Copy of cancelled cheque or passbook or bank statement containing your name, account number, IFSC and MICR code
    Please remember to take original documents to the DP for verification. In case you are unable to produce original document for verification, then photocopy should be attested by any authorized entity, like a public notary. Your DP may ask additional proof of identity / address to meet its requirements in addition to above-mentioned. The process of account opening is shown in the diagram below </li>

    <li><a name="question5"> </a>  Answer 5 <br> It is mandatory to establish the identity of the applicant at the time of opening account as per SEBI guidelines. This is done by the DP’s staff by verifying the affixed photograph on account opening form and the photo seen on document on PAN card with the person seeking to open the account. For Joint account holders, the ’in-person verification’ is required for all the holders.</li><a href="faqpart1.html"> Home </a>
    <li> <a name="question6"> </a>Answer 6 <br> Yes. You can open more than one account with the same DP. There is no restriction on the number of accounts you can open with a DP.</li><a href="faqpart1.html"> Home </a>
    <li> <a name="question7"> </a> Answer 7  <br> No. The depository has not prescribed any minimum balance. You can have zero balance in your demat account</li> <br><a href="faqpart1.html"> Home </a>
    <li> <a name="question8"> </a> Answer8 <br> Providing bank account details at the time of demat account opening is mandatory. These bank details are communicated to issuer companies / RTAs for the purpose of crediting any amount payable to you (such as dividend, interest or maturity payment or redemption amount) directly in your bank account. It is therefore suggested that you provide details of your active bank account in the account opening form. Later, in case of change therein, please remember to inform to your DP.</li><a href="faqpart1.html"> Home </a>
    <li> <a name="question9"> </a> Answer 9 <br> In demat account, debit or credit transactions are permitted only if it is duly authorized by the respective holder(s). As a Delivery Instruction Slip (DIS) is required for every debit transfer in the demat account, a 'Receipt Instruction Slip' is required for every credit transfer in the demat account. By giving a onetime standing instruction to your DP, you may avoid giving receipt instruction to your DP whenever a credit is expected in the account.</li><a href="faqpart1.html"> Home </a>
